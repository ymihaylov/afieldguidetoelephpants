This elePHPant was created by the website hosting company [SiteGround](https://www.siteground.com) to celebrate the release of PHP 8 with PHP enthusiasts. It is a limited-edition fluffy creature that came to life in the very unusual 2020, when the whole world was in a state of pandemic. In nature, when a group or family of elephants come together after a long period of separation, they throw elaborate greeting ceremonies. With the SiteGround elePHPant, we wanted to celebrate the PHP 8 release with the community, even when apart.

With its unique style with different-colored feet and ears, the SiteGround elePHPant is always in the mood to inspire you to explore new releases, develop further your website, and learn new things! Itâ€™s not for sale, but SiteGround uses it for PHP quizzes, raffles, and events, so keep your eyes open for those!
